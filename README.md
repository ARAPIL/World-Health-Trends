# World-Health-Trends Animated

A Tableau Visualization with Animations. The animation shows how population of countries across the world have been developing over the past 50 years. How fertility rate and life expectancy change over the years. World population dataset was used as primary data source. Fertility rate and life expectancy data sets were blended as secondary data sources. Data relationships were edited, and Country codes and years were connected across datasets. On a scatter plot graphs showing the fertility rate and life expectancy for each country was depicted. The size of the circles indicated the population size. Pages function was used to animate the visualization. It allows to see on the scatter plot graph how it changed during years. The dashboard was designed to allow the user for some customization over the animation. The history of each country can be depicted with mark and trails. It allows to see each country separately, or a region or the whole countries together.
